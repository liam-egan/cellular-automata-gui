# cellular-automata-gui

This is a random pet project of mine, done as a final project in AP Computer Science, which I expanded on in order to add more functionality and clean up the code a bit.

The project is a GUI made with Swing which allows you to manipulate a cellular automaton by switching its ruleset and exploring its states both forward and backward in time.

## Development

To compile `.java` files in the `src/` directory:

```
$ make build
```

To run `Main.class` in the `bin/` directory once compiled:

```
$ make run
```

To do both of the above steps:

```
$ make exec
```
